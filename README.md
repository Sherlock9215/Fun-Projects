# Fun-Projects

This is a repo for any side projects I will be working on.

Currently I'm working on following project/s:

1. Making an application which shouts random guitar chords(initially provided by the user), so that a beginner guitar player can practice chord changes. 
2. I have added a new list
3. This is for the remote changes
