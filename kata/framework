1) to read a file in java:
 * store the file in dererctly under the project, i.e.  kata
 * Use Scanner:
  public void readFile() {
          weatherFile = new File("weather.txt");
          try {
              scanner = new Scanner(weatherFile);
              System.out.println("File was read successfully");
          } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
              System.out.println("File was not found");
          }
      }


2) To Do:
    * Create tests for readFile and parseFile
    * resume Kata
